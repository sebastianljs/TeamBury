%This is Eric Peshkin's super swell Building Hypothesis Code. Welcome. I have
%updated the comments so they should be more descriptive. Also, the very
%last step may change substantially depending on how one interprets
%Saeedi's code. I will be checking this in class tomorrow and then changing
%or not changing it afterwards, appropriately.

%Inputs are a list of X1...X4 and Y1...Y4 as building hypotheses where each
%XN = [xn1 , xn2] and each YN = [yn1 , yn2]
%Random lines are of the form [[xk1,xk2;yk1,yk2],[x(k+1)1,x(k+1)2;y(k+1)1,y(k+2)2]...]
%(see linecell in code for an example of the other lines format)

%Output is explained in comment at bottom of code.

%VARIABLES TO TINKER WITH:
tuberad = 1.05; %The radius of the tubes (also determines the parallel "height beyond lines"
mintheta = 15; %The value of degrees for which all relevant 'other' lines must be within relative to the 'hypothesis' line in question.

%Generate sample hypotheses. We want 4. This is for the sake of testing
%things.
%Hypothesis:

%Note: "Hypothesis" is in red. "Non-hypothesis" lines are in blue.

%STEP 1: Tube Creation. Tube is in green. Want a tube for every line in
%hypothesis.

%Tube 3: Right Side TUBULAR DUDE! (Right - Left = pos)
tx3 = [X3(1)+tuberad,X3(2)+tuberad,X3(2)-tuberad,X3(1)-tuberad,X3(1)+tuberad,X3(2)+tuberad];
ty3 = [Y3(1)-tuberad,Y3(2)+tuberad,Y3(2)+tuberad,Y3(1)-tuberad,Y3(1)-tuberad,Y3(2)+tuberad];

%Tube 4: Bottom Side TUBULAR BRO! (Top - Bot = positive)

plot(tx4,ty4,'.-','color','green')

%STEP 2: Find all lines that are fully or partially within the tubes. (From
%the set of III-A-5
%(use inpolygon to determine whether both endpoints are in the tube)

%Check all lines for interior of Tube 1:

%Linelist is list of suspect lines. Currently as [[x1,x2;y1,y2]]
linelist = [[0.5,2;2,6],[0,7;0,8],[1.6,3.9;6.9,6.9],[3.95,4.1;5,5.1],[2,3;5,4],[1.5,2.5;6,5],[3,4;2,3]];
linecell = cell(length(linelist)/2,1);
for i = 1:(length(linelist)/2);
    linecell{i,1} = linelist(4*i-3:4*i);
end

end
%TubeNArray is a vertical matrix for which every row corresponds to a
%point for tube 1:N. Every second row begins a new "line". 
%Let's split this into 7 2x1 doubles, each of which contains a single "line's" validity info.

Tube4Lines = mat2cell(Tube4Array,zeros(1,(size(Tube4Array,1)/2))+2,[1]);

%Now we will seperate any lines that "fit" (or one pt in the line is in the
%polygon, to check for the entire line in polygon switch to [0;0] on all.)
%The process will be carried out for each line one at a time from now on.
%Tube 1:
count = 0;
for k = 1:length(Tube1Lines);
    if cell2mat(Tube1Lines(k)) == [1;1]; %%%%%%
        %counter variable to determine size of the chosen lines cell.

outputlinesandscores
%outputlinesandscores is a cell with two columns. The second contains the
%score associated with any four lines. The first contains the four lines in
%the format [x1, y1; x2, y2]*4, for the four lines. The first two columns
%within this column of outputlinesandscores belong to the first line, and so on.
